const.py has all constants. Look here first for values

Data is collated into an sqlite3 database named in const.py by
DBFILE.

I have tried to make the program fault tolerant, and if files can not be
read in directories, or a fatal error occurs, an email is sent to
TOADDR. I have tried to allow the program to continue after non fatal
errors

The command line executable is 
0)rds_rdmp_data.py
which calls functions in 
1)rdmp_lib_data.py
2)rds_data.py
3)user_access.py

0) Must be run as root, as some of the log files are only readable by root.
It is passed command line parameters, and these are shown if you execute
it with no command line parameters. They are

* importrdsinfo
The functions for this are in rds_data.py. This reads all the files in 
RDS_FOLDER (except ones starting with '.'), and parses the text
to find the data to import into RDS_TABLE, that is space, plan etc.
the latest file name is stored, and when called again, all files
that have been read are ignored.

* importlibinfo
The functions for this are in rdmp_lib_data.py.
This reads all the files in RDMP_FOLDER, and moves them into 
RDMP_FOLDER giving them an .xml extension. The XML is parsed
using python's ElementTree, and the RDMP_TABLE is populated

* importuser
The functions or this are in user_access.py.
ZID_LOG_FILES (http.1.log, http.2.log) are checked as
to which is newer. The newer log file is processed, and data
is gathered once a log date is greater than that already stored 
in the database or 1st Jan 1970 if no date exists in the database.
A user is stored only once in the table with a first access time
that does not change. If they are found again in the log file, 
the last access time is updated.

* export
This selects everything from the RDS_STATS_TABLE and exports
it to a csv file which is named after teh date and put in
EXPORT_DIR

* transfer
This emails the latest CSV file in EXPORT_DIR to TOADDR

* stats
This emails statistics in CSV form to TOADDR. The statistics are
generated from the tables to give the results as per the specifications
Shane showed me on the mock-up he created of the statistics page.

Root crontab now has
